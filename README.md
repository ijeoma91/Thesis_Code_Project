# Thesis_Code_Project
This is a recommendation system development project. In this project, there are serveral algorithms used to actualized this project goal. One of the several algorithms used is Natural Language processing techniques to  analyze a collection of unstructured text data was was collected from Kaggle open source data. We also used three important metrics called cosine similarity, adjusted cosine similarity and soft cosine similarity in order to understand the constxtual relationship between candidates profile or resume and job posting data. Using this metrics jobs will be matched to candidate using transformer and every embedding which was generated will be stored in the database called PostgreSQL.

#Getting Started

## Dependencies Libraiers
. pandas: For data analysis, cleaning, exploring and manipulation
. Numpy: This is used for arry-preprocessing package
. Nltk.download(stopwords)
. apt-get (Postgresql development tools)
. pgvector: This is used for PostgreSQL extension for handling and performing similarity searches on vector embeddings. (Important Library
. Django: This is a high-level python web framework designed to facilite the developement of secure, scalable, maintainable web application
. Regex: A sequence of characters that defines a search pattern. Used for pattern matching in strings
. openaiRouter: This is a platform that provides a unified interface for accessing various large lanagauage model (LLMs) through a single API
. L1 Distance: The L1 distance is used to sum the absolute difference between the cooridinates of two points.
. L2 Distance:  The L2 distance is the straight-line distance between two points in space
. MaxInnerProduct: This basically refer to the computatio of the maximum inner product between a query vector and set of vectors. Used in ML, or recommendataion systems. 


## Software to install to Run Code
